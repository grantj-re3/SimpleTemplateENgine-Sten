<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
	An 'HTML template' is an html file where special tokens (or keys)
	will be replaced by other content as determined by the properties of
	the tokens.
</p>

<p>
	Style and layout are determined by one or more common CSS files partnered
	with a single HTML template file. However the tokens within the template
	allow you to have individual content on each page on your web-site by
	having one PHP file (eg. index.php) per web-page which loads the
	tokens with appropriate content.
</p>

<p>
	Sten sends the specified 'HTML template' to stdout (ie. the
	browser), while replacing template-file tokens from the Sten template-object
	on-the-fly. A maximum of 1 substitution is permitted per template-line.
</p>

<p>
	Within the template file,
	<pre>
	&lt;!-- {{TOKEN_NAME}} --&gt;
	</pre>
	will be replaced.
	TOKEN_NAME can be any upper or lower case alpha-numeric plus dot '.' and
	underscore '_'.  In order to be replaced, the TOKEN_NAME in the html-template file must
	match a TOKEN_NAME in the Sten object.  The type of replacement shall be
	determined by the TOKEN_TYPE and TOKEN_VALUE associated with the TOKEN_NAME.
</p>
